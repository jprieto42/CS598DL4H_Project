To use this project you must download it on to your local computer then extract/unzip all the datasets provided that are compressed. Make sure the datasets are in the same directory as the jupyter notebook.

## Environment Requirements
To use this jupyter notebook you must have an environment set up with:
- Python3.6.5
- Tensorflow 1.13.1
- pandas 
- numpy 
- sklearn

Note: Where version is specified you must make sure to get that specific version or the code will throw errors.

If using anaconda to test or use this project here is a helpful article that gives instructions to getting a newly created conda environment to show up in Jupyter notebook interface : https://medium.com/@jy.wong.xeron/managing-jupyter-notebooks-and-conda-environments-6b8c627e0c2f

Once environment is set up and project is downloaded, just run the cells sequentially.
